Have a link to exercises on my homepage under Tutoring. 

Show a list of exercises as buttons to click on. After click:
On first visit ask for their name and occupation/study corse. Have a drop down and if they pick other let them fill it in themselves as a text box.

Ask for study corse and semester.
If they solved 10 exercises make a one time popup with a share link for friends.
Find a master to ask about storing the IP adress and what my actual goals are. Ask him for guidance on what other options I have.
